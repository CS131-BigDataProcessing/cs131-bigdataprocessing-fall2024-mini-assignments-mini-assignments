1. What are all the airlines? What awk command did you use to get this information?
Using the command "awk -F, '{print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq", I was able to retrieve the unique airlines in the dataset which are "Alaska", "American", "Delta", "Jet Blue", "Southwest", "United" 


2. Which airlines have:
A. Has a carrier delay greater than 10 and print airline names (alphabetically. Hint* pipe input into sort)
Using the command "awk -F, '$1 > 10 {print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq
", I was able to retrieve the unique airlines in the dataset which have a carrier delay greater than 10 which are "Alaska", "American", "Delta", "Jet Blue", "Southwest", and "United".

B. Has a carrier delay greater than a certain threshold of 15? Use -v to pass in a value that is set to 'Threshold = 15'  
Using the command "awk -v threshold=15 -F, '$1 > threshold {print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq", I was able to retrieve the unique airlines in the dataset that have a carrier delay greater than a certain threshold of 15 which are "Alaska", "American", "Delta", "Jet Blue", "Southwest", and "United".
