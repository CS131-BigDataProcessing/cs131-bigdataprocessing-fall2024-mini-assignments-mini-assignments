I reviewed my classmate Aaron's crime dataset package and it was well-structured, and the installation process was straightforward, 
with clear instructions provided in the README file. The functions were well thought out, and 
their intended behavior was explained adequately. 
My classmate was able to install the packages and run the files with no errors. 
Having a package made it simple for my classmate to run the code effectively. 
This mutual testing experience was insightful and reinforced the importance of clear documentation, 
robust error handling, and performance optimization when developing reusable code. 
It also highlighted the value of collaboration in identifying blind spots and enhancing code quality.
